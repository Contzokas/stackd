- ‚úÖ Permission management (owner/editor/viewer)
- ‚úÖ Permanent cloud storage

## üìã Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Note:** If you get a PowerShell execution policy error, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
Then try the npm install again.

### Step 2: Set Up Clerk (Authentication)

1. Go to [https://clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new application
3. Choose your authentication methods (Email, Google, GitHub, etc.)
4. Copy your API keys from the dashboard

### Step 3: Set Up Supabase (Database)

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the database to be provisioned (~2 minutes)
4. Go to **Settings > API** and copy:
   - Project URL
   - `anon` public key
   - `service_role` secret key

### Step 4: Run the Database Schema

1. In Supabase, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file `supabase-schema.sql` from your project
3. Copy all the SQL code
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to create all tables and security policies

### Step 5: Create Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   copy .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` and fill in your keys:

```env
# Clerk Authentication (from clerk.com dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Clerk URLs (keep these as-is)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

# Supabase (from supabase.com project settings)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.xxxxxxxxxxxxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 6: Start Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- **Protected API routes**: All API endpoints require authentication

## üìÅ New Files Created

### Core Files
- `lib/supabase.js` - Supabase client configuration
- `supabase-schema.sql` - Database schema with RLS policies
- `.env.local.example` - Environment variables template

### Authentication
- `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.js` - Sign in page
- `app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.js` - Sign up page
- `middleware.js` - Route protection

### API Routes
- `app/api/boards/route.js` - List and create boards
- `app/api/boards/[boardId]/route.js` - Get, update, delete boards
- `app/api/boards/[boardId]/share/route.js` - Share boards with users
- `app/api/columns/route.js` - CRUD operations for columns
- `app/api/cards/route.js` - CRUD operations for cards

### Components
- `components/CloudBoardManager.jsx` - Cloud-synced board manager
- `components/ShareBoardModal.jsx` - UI for sharing boards
- Updated `components/BoardSelector.jsx` - Added share button

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" errors
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check that your `.env.local` has the correct Clerk keys

### Database errors
- Verify you ran the `supabase-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- Check that RLS policies are enabled

### Real-time not working
- Confirm Supabase project has Realtime enabled (it's on by default)
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### Can't share boards
- Make sure the User ID is correct (starts with `user_`)
- Verify the target user has created an account in your app
