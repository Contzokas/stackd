# Supabase Storage Setup for Card Images

## Step 1: Run the Database Migration

Run the SQL in `add-card-images.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to add the `image_url` column to the cards table.

## Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Bucket**
4. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `card-images`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ… YES (check this box)
   - Click **Create bucket**

## Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, click on it and go to **Policies**:

### Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload images
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'card-images');
```

### Policy 2: Allow public read access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'card-images');
```

### Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own images
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'card-images');
```

## Step 4: Configure Bucket Settings (Optional)

In the bucket settings, you can set:
- **File size limit**: 5MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp`

## Testing

After setup:
1. Create or open a card
2. Click the "ðŸ“Ž Click to upload image" button
3. Select an image file
4. The image should upload and display immediately
5. You can remove it by clicking the âœ• button on the image

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails with "new row violates row-level security policy"**
- Make sure the storage policies are created
- Verify the bucket is set to **public**

**Images don't display**
- Check that the bucket is set to **public**
- Verify the public read access policy is enabled

**"Bucket not found" error**
- Make sure the bucket name is exactly `card-images`
- Refresh your app and try again
